  "about": "One by one, people are entering a grey building as if to escape from the never-ending rain.\nVery few know about what is going on in this once abandoned but now heavily modified building. Every weekend night, it is filled with music and light, packed with dancing people. This is GHOSTCLUB, the place where the \"whispered\" people come together.\n\nStomping and splashing in puddles, two just rushed into the entrance.\n\"Isn't it raining all the time around here...?\"\nOne says while removing the hood from their raincoat.\n\"I guess so,\" the other answers flicking raindrops, \"I suppose it is just the climate here, though.\"\n\"Well...\"\n\"What's the problem? I really like the rainy atmosphere around here.\"\n\"Of course I like it too. But I'm just a bit curious ― would it ever be sunny once in a while.\"\n\nThey seem to have chosen to sit on the stairs near the entrance until the club opens. There are already a lot of people waiting in the atrium. All of them are the \"whispered\" ones, came to this place guided by the whisper ― just as the two are.\n\"I still have no idea how so many people come here from where...\"\n\"Well, everyone is wondering about that, I suppose?\"\nThe giggling voices of the two quickly faded into the moist air and the sound of the never-ending rain.",
